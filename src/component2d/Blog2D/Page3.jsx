                            <p className="text-[15px] text-justify mb-5">It’s always a good idea to do a thorough research first and then jump into action. The same applies for product photography. Being new
to this e-commerce business, it’s more likely that you’re not an expert in product photography. This is why you need to focus on educating
yourself first. List down the big companies in your industry and visit their website. Now try to comprehend the techniques they are applying
in photographing their product; the number and types of photos they are posting, the angles being used etc. For example- you may
notice websites posting a main photo consisting of only the product and other shots where details of the product are properly highlighted.
You can see videos on YouTube as well and read different blogs as well to get an initial understanding of product photography as well.</p>

                            <p className="text-[15px] text-justify">For a small business, affording a full formal photo studio along with the expensive tools in it may seem scary. And keeping the amount
of sales you’re likely to make or the range of collections a small business may own, it doesn’t seem worth it as well. You do not need a
fully designed photo studio to photograph your products. Rather, you can easily setup a home studio and photograph your products there.
Pick a comfortable corner of your house with good lighting and decorate it with a table, tripod, camera and a white cloth for the background.
That’s it, you’re good to go!</p>
